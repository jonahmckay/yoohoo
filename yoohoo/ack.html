				YooHoo is an interactive fiction project made by Audrey Coulombe, Artem Gloukhov, and Jonah McKay for CART 211.
			</p>
			<p>
				While it may seem absurd that someone would share data like their credit card number with the public,
				people using social media platforms share information about themselves each day that could be used
				for purposes they might not knowingly consent to. Each person draws the line at a different point for
				what data they consider "public".
			</p>
			  Even data that's not shared with the public can reach third parties through data leaks. YooHoo asked
				you to draw a line somewhere: Where did you draw it? Did you provide your real name or e-mail to sign in, or
				did you use a pseudonym?
			</p>
			<p>
				While YooHoo asks for your real information, there's nothing verifying your inputs.
